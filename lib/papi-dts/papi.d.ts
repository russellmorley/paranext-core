     * whitelists those urls so you can embed iframes with those urls as the `src` attribute. By
     * default, no urls are available to be iframes. If you want to embed iframes with the `src`
     * attribute in your webview, you must include them in this property.
     *
     * For example, if you specify `allowFrameSources: ['https://example.com/']`, you will be able to
     * embed iframes with urls starting with `papi-extension:` and on the same host as
     * `https://example.com/`

     * [`test`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test)
     * function) to determine whether this iframe will be allowed to load. Specifying urls in this
     * array is essentially a security check to make sure the url you pass is one of the urls you
     * intend it to be. By default, the url you specify in `content` will be accepted (you do not have
     * to specify this unless you want to, but it is recommended in some scenarios).
     *
     * Note: URL WebViews must have `papi-extension:` or `https:` urls. This property does not
     * override that requirement.
     *
     * For example, if you specify `allowFrameSources: ['^papi-extension:',
     * '^https://example\\.com.*']`, only `papi-extension:` and `https://example.com` urls will be
     * accepted.
     *
     * If your WebView url is a `const` string and cannot change for any reason, you do not need to

     * best practice to specify this property and to list only the urls you need for your URL WebView
     * to function. The more you list, the higher the theoretical security risks.

   * Network objects are distributed objects within PAPI for TS/JS objects. @see
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_object
   *
   * Objects registered via {@link networkObjectService.set} are retrievable using
   * {@link networkObjectService.get}.
   *
   * Function calls made on network objects retrieved via {@link networkObjectService.get} are proxied
   * and sent to the original objects registered via {@link networkObjectService.set}. All functions on
   * the registered object are proxied except for constructors, `dispose`, and functions starting with
   * `on` since those should be events (which are not intended to be proxied) based on our naming
   * convention. If you don't want a function to be proxied, don't make it a property of the
   * registered object.
   *
   * Functions on a network object will be called asynchronously by other processes regardless of
   * whether the functions are synchronous or asynchronous, so it is best to make them all
   * asynchronous. All shared functions' arguments and return values must be serializable to be called
   * across processes.
   *
   * When a service registers an object via {@link networkObjectService.set}, it is the responsibility
   * of that service, and only that service, to call `dispose` on that object when it is no longer
   * intended to be shared with other services.
   *
   * When an object is disposed by calling `dispose`, all functions registered with the `onDidDispose`
   * event handler will be called. After an object is disposed, calls to its functions will no longer
   * be proxied to the original object.
